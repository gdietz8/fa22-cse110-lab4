4. The code returns an error because `let` variables do not ignore code blocks. This means that since result was defined within the `if` statement code block, it is not defined outside of it and cannot be referenced in line 13.
5. Variables declared using `const` cannot be redefined, and an attempt to do so will cause an error. `result` is declared as a `const` in line 5 equal to 0, but in line 7, `result` is assigned to equal `num1` plus `num2`. This will cause an error.
