1. `i` is decalared as a `var` variable, which means it is visible through code blocks within the same function. In this case `i` is increased in the for loop until it is greater than or equal to the length of `prices`. In line 12, `i` is still visible and is equal to 3. </br>**The output is: 3**
2. `discountedPrice` is decalared as a `var` variable, which means it is visible through code blocks within the same function. In this case `discountedPrice` is calculated by multiplying the price at index `i` by the discount passed in as the third argument to the `discountPrices` function. In the last iteration of the for loop, `discountedPrice` is set equal to `prices[2] * (1 - discount)`. This is equal to 150. In line 13, `discountedPrice` is still visible and is equal to 150. </br>**The output is: 150**
3. `finalPrice` is decalared as a `var` variable, which means it is visible through code blocks within the same function. In this case `discountedPrice` is calculated by rounding the `discountedPrice` to the nearest integer. In the last iteration of the for loop, `discountedPrice` is set equal to `prices[2] * (1 - discount)`. This is equal to 150. `finalPrice` is set equal to `Math.round(discountedPrice * 100) / 100`, which also equals 150. In line 13, `finalPrice` is still visible and is equal to 150. </br>**The output is: 150**
